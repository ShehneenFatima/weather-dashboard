# Weather Dashboard

## Overview
The Weather Dashboard project is designed to visualize weather data, providing real-time insights into various weather conditions. It features data fetching, processing, and dynamic visualizations.

## Features
- Fetch weather data from APIs.
- Display weather information through charts and graphs.
- Use `matplotlib` for plotting weather data.
- Pre-configured with code quality tools like `flake8`, `isort`, and `black`.

## Key Aspects
- **Code Quality Assurance:**
  - The project ensures adherence to **PEP8** coding standards by using `flake8` and `black`.
  - **isort** is used for sorting import statements to maintain consistent structure.
  - **Pre-commit hooks** are configured to automatically enforce these standards before each commit.

- **Merge Requests:**
  - GitHub merge requests (MRs) are created to ensure code review and approval before merging changes into the main branch.

## Tools and Libraries
- **flake8**: A Python linting tool to ensure code quality by following PEP8.
- **black**: A code formatter that automatically formats Python code according to PEP8.
- **isort**: A tool for sorting imports in Python files.
- **Pre-commit**: A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
